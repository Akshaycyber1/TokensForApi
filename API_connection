=>> To fetch data from the LDAP server after logging in to the APK using the API, you can use a step-by-step flow where both authentication and authorization processes ensure that the API calls to retrieve data are legitimate. Here's the full scenario:
🌏🛡️👉

Step-by-Step Flow:
1. User Login via APK (Authentication):
👉 User enters credentials (username and password) into the APK.
👉 The APK sends these credentials to the API (e.g., /login) over HTTPS.
👉 The API authenticates the credentials by verifying them against your LDAP server.
      ●  The LDAP server may return an acknowledgment if the credentials are correct.
      ●  If valid, the API generates a JWT token and returns it to the APK.


🌏 Key Step:
> The JWT token is signed using a secret key or public/private key pair and includes the user’s information (like user ID) and an expiry time.
> The APK stores this token securely (e.g., encrypted SharedPreferences).



2. Fetching Data from LDAP (Authorization):
> After login, the user wants to retrieve some data from the LDAP server via an API call. Here’s how the process works:

🌏 JWT Token in API Request:
:- The APK initiates an API call (e.g., /getLDAPData) to fetch data from the LDAP server.
:- In this API call, the APK includes the JWT token in the Authorization header like this:

>>>>>>>> Authorization: Bearer <JWT-Token>   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<




🌏 API Verifies JWT Token:
> The API server checks if the JWT token is valid:
> Signature verification: The server verifies the JWT signature using its secret or public key. 
> Token expiry check: It checks if the token is still valid (not expired).
> Payload validation: The API verifies the user’s identity and permissions from the JWT payload.
> If the JWT token is valid, the API proceeds to the next step. If not, it rejects the request.

👉 API Fetches Data from LDAP:
 ● The API (which acts as a middleman or proxy) makes a request to the LDAP server to retrieve the data the user requested.
 ● The API can use the user’s identity (from the JWT) to fetch specific data related to that user.
 ● The LDAP server verifies that the API has legitimate access, as the API has already authenticated the user.


🌏 Key Points in Verification:
👉 The LDAP server trusts that the API is legitimate because:
● The API is on a secure network and authorized to interact with the LDAP server.
● The API may use a pre-configured service account or credentials to authenticate itself to the LDAP server, ensuring the call is legitimate.
● The API is responsible for user verification, so LDAP doesn't need to re-check the user’s identity directly.



👉 Response from LDAP:
●  Once the LDAP server returns the requested data to the API, the API forwards this data back to the APK as the response to the user’s request.



3. Client-Side (APK) Displays Data:
● The APK receives the LDAP data from the API and displays it to the user.
●  How is Legitimacy Verified in API Calls?



🌏 API-Server Trust:
●  The LDAP server trusts the API server to handle user verification. The API server has access to the LDAP data on behalf of users.


🌏 JWT Token for User Authentication:
👉 The API validates the JWT token, ensuring the user making the request is legitimate. Only if the token is valid, the API fetches the LDAP data.



🛡️ Secure Communication:
👉 All communication (APK <-> API, API <-> LDAP) happens over HTTPS, ensuring data is encrypted and secure.



🛡️ Recap:
     1. Login: User logs into the APK, and the API authenticates the user against the LDAP server.
     2. JWT Token Issued: If authentication is successful, the API issues a JWT token to the APK.
     3. Data Fetch Request: The APK requests data from the LDAP server via the API, attaching the JWT token.
     4. API Verification: The API verifies the JWT token and ensures the user is authenticated.
     5. Data Retrieval: The API fetches the requested data from the LDAP server and returns it to the APK.
     6. This flow ensures both authentication (via the login process and JWT token) and authorization (via token verification before accessing LDAP data).
